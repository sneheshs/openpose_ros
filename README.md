# openpose_ros
Example ros catkin package that utilizes the openpose library from https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.

## System
Tested on:
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 
* Ros Indigo
* CUDA 8.0
* cuDNN 5.1
* OpenCV 3.2

## Installation Steps
1. Install openpose (not in catkin_workspace).
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose.git
   ```
2. Clone the glog_catkin repository into your catkin_workspace/src directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethz-asl/glog_catkin.git
   ```
3. Clone the gflags repository into your catkin_workspace/src directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davetcoleman/gflags.git
   ```
4. Clone the catkin_simple repository into your catkin_workspace/src directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple.git
   ```
5. Clone this repository into your catkin_workspace/src directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/firephinx/openpose_ros.git
   ```
6. Use this only if you want to use RGB-D camera supported with OpenNI.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install ros-kinetic-openni2-launch 
   ```
7. Modify the following lines in the CMakeLists.txt to the proper directories of where you installed caffe and openpose:
   ```bash
   set(CAFFE_DIR /path/to/caffe)
   set(OPENPOSE_DIR /path/to/openpose)
   ```
8. Modify the model_folder line in src/openpose_ros_node.cpp and src/openpose_ros_node_with_face_and_hands.cpp to where openpose is installed.
   ```bash
   DEFINE_string(model_folder,    "/path/to/openpose/models/",    "Folder where the pose models (COCO and MPI) are located.");
   ```
9. Modify the image_topic line in src/openpose_ros_node.cpp and src/openpose_ros_node_with_face_and_hands.cpp to the image_topic you want to process.
   ```bash
   DEFINE_string(camera_topic,    "/camera/image_raw",    "Image topic that OpenPose will process.");
   ```
10. Modify the other parameters in src/openpose_ros_node.cpp and src/openpose_ros_node_with_face_and_hands.cpp to your liking such as the net_resolution and resolution of the image.
11. Run catkin_make from your catkin_workspace directory. (It will fail the first time so run it twice.)

### Potential Installation Issues
1. If cv_bridge is causing you errors and/or you decide to use OpenCV 3.2, copy the cv_bridge folder from https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv into your catkin_workspace/src directory. 
2. If you have problems with CUDA during catkin_make, uncomment this line # find_package(CUDA REQUIRED)

## Running
```bash
source catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash
rosrun openpose_ros openpose_ros_node  ### Just body pose
rosrun openpose_ros openpose_ros_node_with_face_and_hands ### Body pose, face, and hands
```

## Running With ROS and RGB-D
```bash
source catkin_workspace/devel/setup.bash
roscore
rosrun rviz rviz
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
rosrun openpose_ros openpose_ros_node  ### Just body pose
rosrun openpose_ros openpose_ros_node_with_face_and_hands ### Body pose, face, and hands
```
